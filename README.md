Create an employee database using SQL


## Overview
The goal is to create a database, using SQL, that will track the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results

- There are over 70,000 employees close to retierment.

- Of the employees close to retierment, the highest number have the title of senior engineer.

- Less then 2000 employees are ready for the metorship program.

## Summary
There are far more people approching retierment age then those eligible for a mentorship positioin.  Most of the people approching retierment and in high level positions.  If mentorship programs are not put in place all of that experience and knowledge could be lost, causeing a strain on the business.  A helpful table to look at would be a table that shows a brakedown of department, total employees in that department, and how many will retire or could be a mentor.  Looking at that you could see witch departments will need the most help in the futre and have a chance to get ahead of the problem.  Another table that would be usful is one that could analyse the average length of an employees stay at the company.  Knowing how meny people leave before retierment could help the company see the chance of a new hire staying through retierment.  This will effect how many employees are avalible to fill the hole left by the silver tsunami.
